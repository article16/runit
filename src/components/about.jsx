        Running delivers myriad health benefits for body and mind. These are too
        numerous to cover in full here, but let’s give you a taste: in a study
        of 55,000 people, US researchers at Iowa State University found running
        three times a week for an average of just 17 minutes each time reduced
        the risk of fatal heart attack or stroke by 55 per cent. Three weekly
        aerobic exercise sessions also improved glucose control in a University
        of Ottawa study, while research from the University of Costa Rica found
        running lowered blood pressure more effectively than cycling.
